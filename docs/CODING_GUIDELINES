Use underscores for the start of all private variables/properties/methods

All external class property access should be through set/get methods, to facilitate for adding
validation/error checking logic in at a later date.

Try to use one internal method each for getting and setting, and all methods that perform
extra processing you the master methods.

Class and method names to begin with a lower case letter and be camelCase

Constants should be in UPPER_CASE

Two empty lines should be used between methods and classes and groups of global vars. Single
empty lines should be used to break up code for readability, but no more.
